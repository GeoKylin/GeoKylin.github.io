    "content": " The Earth\u0026rsquo;s solid inner core grows from the solidification of the liquid outer core. The solidification process releases latent heat and expels light elements, providing driving forces for the outer core convection and the geodynamo which generates the Earth\u0026rsquo;s magnetic field. Thus, the information of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s inner core boundary is important for our understanding of the thermo-compositional state of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s core.\nLocalized Mushy ICB  Localized mushy zone at the Earth’s inner core boundary beneath southwest Okhotsk Sea.  (a) PKiKP-PcP travel time residuals, plotted at the PKiKP bouncing points at the ICB, which was excited by seismic source (red star) and recorded by Hi-net stations (black triangles). Positive and negative PKiKP-PcP travel time residuals are denoted by circles and triangles, respectively, with the size of symbols proportional to the absolute value of residuals. (b) Compressional velocity profile of the best-fitting model across the ICB (red line) represented by two parameters: d the thickness of the layer and $\\delta V_P$ percentage compressional velocity jump of the top layer with respect to PREM velocity jump at ICB, along with PREM (black line). (c) Synthetic seismograms for a series of mushy ICB models (red traces, labeled accordingly with two model parameters: $d$ and $\\delta V_P$) and for PREM (bottom black trace). (d) Comparisons of stacked observed PKiKP waveforms (blue traces), which sample the ICB region beneath southwest Okhotsk Sea and synthetic seismograms (red traces) of the best-fitting models. The number of waveforms used in each stacking is labeled at the right of each trace, while the thickness $d$ and percentage compressional velocity jump of the top layer $\\delta V_P$ of the best-fitting models are labeled above the red traces.

    "summary": "By using an on-site collapse event as a reference and eliminating path effects\nof seismic-wave propagation, we constrain source characteristics of\nNorth Korea's 3 September 2017 nuclear test.\nIn the framework of a complete source model for an underground explosion\nconsisting of an isotropic source representing the explosion and\ntwo secondary sources accompanying the explosion, with one represented by\na double couple (DC) attributed to tectonic release and the other\nan oblique compensated linear vector dipole (CLVD) attributed to source medium damage,\nthe source model of the 2017 test is inferred from its noncircular\nradiation patterns of Rayleigh and Love waves using seismic observations of\nthe collapse as references. Based on the opposite azimuths of the inferred\noblique CLVD of the test and the collapsing force of the event 8.5 min later,\nwe propose a deformation scenario of the 2017 test in that the test generates\na prompt source medium damage expanding away from the test center mostly\nalong the direction of 320°(represented by the oblique CLVD) and the\ndeformed surrounding rocks collapse toward the test center along the weakness\ndirection in an opposite way 8.5 min later (represented by the collapse).\nWe further propose that an inferred obliqueness of CLVD accompanying\na nuclear test may serve an indication of possible collapsing direction\nfor the test. Because the surface‐wave magnitude is strongly contaminated\nby secondary sources, we estimate the yield of the 2017 test to be 109.4±48.6kt\nbased on the body‐wave Lg magnitude.",

In this study, we conduct a survey\nof small seismic events from 1 May 2017 to 25 April 2018 near North Korea's nuclear test site.\nWe report 88 seismic events, including the 2017 nuclear test, the collapse event 8.5 min later,\nand 86 earthquakes afterward. Among the 86 earthquakes, 11 are well constrained to be distributed\nalong a near north–south direction within a region of 2 km, ∼8.4 km north of the test site.\nThe null detection before the 2017 test and the intense seismicity after the test, along with\nthe predicted normal tensile stress the 2017 test applied on the fault, provide strong evidence\nthat the 2017 test triggered these earthquakes. Some characteristics (the distance to the nuclear\ntest center, depth, and magnitude) of these triggered aftershocks fit the general characteristics\nof the aftershocks in the Nevada National Security Site and the Semipalatinsk test site after nuclear tests,\nbut the aftershocks of North Korea’s 2017 test exhibit a different evolution lasting\nat least eight months with two bursts occurring on early December 2017 and early February 2018\nand an otherwise general low occurrence rate, possibly caused by a different geological setting of the test site.",

    "summary": "Modern seismology has revealed complex structures of the Earth's inner core and its boundary.\nThe interior of the Earth’s inner core exhibits both velocity and attenuation anisotropy,\nand hemispherical variations of velocity, attenuation and anisotropy, while the surface of\nthe inner core possesses topography and mushy zone in some localized regions.\nThe inner core velocity and attenuation anisotropy is cylindrical with the axis of high velocity\nand high attenuation parallel with the Earth's rotation axis, and depth dependent with the topmost\n100–400 km close to be isotropic and the innermost 300–600 km possibly possessing a distinct anisotropy.\nThe hemispherical variations in the inner core are manifested in many aspects: the isotropic velocity of\nthe topmost ~100 km of the eastern hemisphere is 0.8% faster than that of the western hemisphere,\nthe attenuation in the top ~100 km of the eastern hemisphere (Q=250) is stronger than that of the\nwestern hemisphere (Q=600), the top isotropic layer is thinner in the western hemisphere (~100 km)\nthan in the eastern hemisphere (~400 km), and the inner core anisotropy in the western hemisphere (~4%)\nis stronger than in the eastern hemisphere (~0.7%). In the boundary, the inner core exhibits\ntopographic variations with height changes of 1–14 km beneath the Philippine Sea, the Yellow Sea,\nthe western Pacific and Central America, and a mushy zone with a thickness of 4–8 km beneath\nthe southwest Okhotsk Sea. These new findings have motivated a series of new physical mechanisms in the\nscientific community and demand for reevaluation of outer core composition, thermal-compositional convection\nin the outer core, inner core solidification process and driving force of Earth's geodynamo.\nThese results suggest that the inner core solidification process and the driving force of Earth's\ngeodynamo are not laterally homogeneous, as it has long been held in the traditional views.\nSolidification may occur in the western hemisphere releasing latent heat and light elements,\nwhile melting may occur in the eastern hemisphere absorbing latent heat and light elements.\nTherefore, the driving forces for the outer core convection in these two hemispheres may be\ndifferent and may even be in opposite signs. Such alternative solidification and melting should\nalso occur in the localized topographic regions. Moreover, the solidification in the region of\na mushy zone would release both thermal and chemical energy, while that in other regions of\na sharp inner core boundary only releases thermal energy.",

Based on waveform modeling of seismic compressional waves\nthat are reflected off the Earth's inner core boundary, here we present seismic evidence for a localized 4–8 km\nthick zone across the inner core boundary beneath southwest Okhotsk Sea with seismic properties intermediate\nbetween those of the inner and outer core and of a mushy zone. Such a localized mushy zone is found to be\nsurrounded by a sharp inner core boundary nearby. These seismic results suggest that,\nin the current thermo-compositional state of the Earth’s core, the outer core composition is close to eutectic\nin most regions resulting in a sharp inner core boundary, but deviation from the eutectic composition exists\nin some localized regions resulting in a mushy zone with a thickness of 4–8 km.",

    "summary": "We find that microseisms generated by Hurricane Sandy exhibit coherent energy within 1 h time windows\nin the frequency band of 0.1–0.25 Hz, but with signals correlated among seismic stations aligned along close azimuths\nfrom the hurricane center. With the identification of this signal property, we show that travel time difference\ncan be measured between the correlated stations. These correlated seismic signals can be attributed to two types\nof seismic sources, with one group of the seismic signals from the hurricane center and the other from coastal region.\nThe seismic sources in coastal region are diffusive and move northward along the coastline as Sandy moves northward.\nWe further develop a hurricane seismic source model, to quantitatively describe the coupling among sea level pressure\nfluctuations, ocean waves, and solid Earth in the region of hurricane center and determine the evolution of source's\nstrength and pressure fluctuation in the region of hurricane center using seismic data. Strong seismic sources are\nalso identified near the coastal region in New England after Sandy's dissipation, possibly related to subsequent\nstorm surge in the area. The seismic method may be implemented as another practical means for hurricane monitoring,\nand seismological estimates of the hurricane seismic source model could be used as in situ proxy measurements of\npressure fluctuation in the region of hurricane center for hurricane physics studies.",

    "summary": "Accurate determination of earthquake depth is important, but particularly challenging.\nWe develop a new method to determine the earthquake source depth by stacking multiple-station autocorrelograms (SMAC)\nof seismic data. The basic concept of SMAC method is to enhance the coherent surface reflected energy\nby autocorrelation and stacking, and uses the surface reflected energy to determine the source depth.\nAutocorrelation effectively enhances the energy of the seismic phases related to the source depth,\nwhile stacking the autocorrelograms of array data further improves the signal-to-noise ratio of the energy.\nThe procedures are applied using both the main SH waves and the coda. Using coda waves,\nthe method extracts the two-way traveltime between the source and the surface\nby stacking the coda wave autocorrelations over an array of seismic observations.\nUsing the main SH waves, SMAC explores the interference of the down-going Moho reflected SmS wave\nand up-going surface bounced Moho reflected sSmS wave by autocorrelation. The autocorrelograms are\nthen stacked along theoretical differential sSmS–SmS traveltime predicted for all potential source depths,\nand the source depth is determined to be the one that produces the maximum stacking energy.\nSynthetic tests demonstrate the validity of the SMAC procedures. As an example of application,\nwe apply the SMAC method to determine the source depth of an earthquake occurring in Japan Island.\nThe procedures of using both main SH waves and their coda waves yield robust surface reflected energy\nand a consistent source depth. The error of the depth estimation is less than 1 km assuming an\nuncertainty of 10 per cent in the averaged crust velocity.",
